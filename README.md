# Hand Gesture Recognition with Python

This repository demonstrates hand gesture recognition using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It contains Python scripts, designed to recognize a distinct hand gesture.

Reproducible Hand Gesture Recognition (0-9)

This repository contains the code for training and running a hand gesture recognition system for digits 0-9.  It details the steps involved in training the model using a digit gesture dataset.  Uses Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The primary programming language.
*   **OpenCV (cv2):** For image and video processing.
*   **MediaPipe:** A framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines, used here for hand landmark detection.
