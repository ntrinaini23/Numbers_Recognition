# Hand Gesture Recognition with Python

This repository demonstrates hand gesture recognition using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It contains two separate Python scripts, each designed to recognize a distinct hand gesture.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The primary programming language.
*   **OpenCV (cv2):** For image and video processing.
*   **MediaPipe:** A framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines, used here for hand landmark detection.

## Gestures Recognized

This repository currently includes recognition for the following gestures:

*   **gesture1.py:**  [Describe the gesture - e.g., "Thumbs Up"].  A brief explanation of how this gesture is detected (e.g., "Detects the relative positions of the thumb and other fingers").
*   **gesture2.py:**  [Describe the gesture - e.g., "Victory/Peace Sign"]. A brief explanation of how this gesture is detected (e.g., "Detects the extended index and middle fingers with other fingers curled").

## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git)
    cd your_repository_name
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe
    ```

## How to Run

Each script can be run independently:

```bash
python gesture1.py  # For the [Gesture Name] gesture
python gesture2.py  # For the [Gesture Name] gesture
