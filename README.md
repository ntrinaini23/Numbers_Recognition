# Hand Gesture Recognition with Python

This repository demonstrates hand gesture recognition using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It contains Python scripts, designed to recognize a distinct hand gesture.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The primary programming language.
*   **OpenCV (cv2):** For image and video processing.
*   **MediaPipe:** A framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines, used here for hand landmark detection.


## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [([https://github.com/ntrinaini23/opencv-mediapipe)](https://github.com/ntrinaini23)]
    cd opencv-mediapipe
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe
    ```
